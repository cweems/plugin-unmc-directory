# Plugin UNMC Directory

This plugin creates an external transfer interface that allows an agent to pick from a list of numbers and initiate an external warm conference.

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Afterwards, install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
cd 

# If you use npm
npm install
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:8080`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3000 npm start
```

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

1. Create a Sync Service
twilio api:sync:v1:services:create --friendly-name=contacts

1. Add a Sync Map
twilio api:sync:v1:services:maps:create --service-sid=ISfd2b646f1011b9eef310f522443c03d9

1. Add Service SID and Map SID as environment variables


## Deploy

Once you are happy with your plugin, you have to bundle it in order to deploy it to Twilio Flex.

Run the following command to start the bundling:

```bash
npm run build
```

Afterwards, you'll find in your project a `build/` folder that contains a file with the name of your plugin project. For example, `plugin-example.js`. Take this file and upload it into the Assets part of your Twilio Runtime.

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.
